# DPGAN
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning models that can generate synthetic data using the probability distribution learned from data. When applying to datasets containing sensitive information, not only the model but also the generated synthetic data can be used to breach the privacy of individuals in the dataset used for training. In this work, we aim to build a differentially private GAN (DPGAN) model which can protect the privacy of individuals. The GAN is responsible for the generation of samples while a DP mechanism ensures the privacy of generated data. The former has applications in any problem where data is scarce while the latter has applications where data is sensitive.  Together, they can be used in a range of implementations including biomedical informatics, public health informatics, census information, etc.  We investigate the means to create a GAN, to add a privacy mechanism, and to optimize the tradeoff between a DPGANâ€™s privacy and utility.  For this project, the resulting DPGAN model will be tested on image data (e.g., MNIST), but in future endeavors it will be used on other image data (e.g., CIFAR and IMAGENET), tabular data (e.g., US Census data), and text data (e.g., IMDB review data).
